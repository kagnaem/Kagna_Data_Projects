# New Zealand International Trade Data Analysis
This was one of my school projects, particularly about analysing New Zealand International data.
I originally used MS Access, Excel, Power BI and DAX for the data analysis. 
This project on Github is another version of my data analysis using Python on GitHub Codespace.
The dataset in CSV format used here is the final product of the combination between the dataset from the Stats NA and External sources: OECD and IMF

A full project paper can be found in my repository here.
