# New Zealand International Trade Data Analysis
This was one of my school projects, particularly about analysing New Zealand International data.
I originally used MS Access, Excel, Power BI and DAX for the data analysis. 
This project on Github is another version of my data analysis using Python on GitHub Codespace.
The CSV dataset used here is the final product of the combination of the datasets from the New Zealand Stats NZ and External sources: OECD and IMF.

A full project paper can be found in my repository here.
